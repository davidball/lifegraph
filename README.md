# lifegraph

This is a little experiment in learning some basic molecular and cell biology by modeling it graphically. 

This project allows for modeling the structures of varios molecules and linking them together and portraying changing systems over time.

GraphViz is used for layouts of still images, then FFMpeg is used to compile the GraphViz output into a simple movie.
