/*
how to refactor:
so there can be a total graph, the set of all edges and nodes ever. 
there can be a series of frames, what to show at a unit of time. 
there can be methods to add/remove edges/nodes from a frame to buidl another frame. 

each frame is sematnicaly a subgraph.   in dat structure it is just a dot structure. 

?or is it?

what about properries at time points?  node and edge properties at time points? 

so do we want to manage graph objects {nodes: {}, edges: {}}.  a global one perhaps but most important an array 
of subgraphs at each time step. 

we woudl convert each subgraph to_dot to make it's dot frame. 

OR do we want to just manage lines in an array of .dot text?   [this seems easy at first but less flxielb.e]

what is a good dsl or data structure for specifiing it. 

Nodes:
    b: blood
    rbc: Red Blood Cell
    l: Leukocytes
    p: platelets

Frames:
    1:
        b
    2:
        b -> rbc
    3: 
        b -> rbc
        b -> l
    4: 
        b -> rbc
        b -> l
        b -> p

OR
Nodes:
    b: blood
    rbc: Red Blood Cell
    l: Leukocytes
    p: platelets

Frames:
    1:
        b
    2:  
        add_edges:
            b -> rbc
    3: 
        add_edges:        
            b -> l
    4: 
        add_edges:
            b -> p

OR
Nodes
    b: blood
    rbc: Red Blood Cell
    l: Leukocytes
    p: platelets


Operations:
b
AddOneEdgePerFrame(b -> rbc, b -> l, b -> p)
AddNodeProp(b, "color:red")
RemoveEdgePerFrame(b -> rbc, b -> p)
AddOneEdgePerFrame()
Frames:
    1:
        b
    2:  
        add_edges:
            b -> rbc
    3: 
        add_edges:        
            b -> l
    4: 
        add_edges:
            b -> p
so we need sometimes to do 1 op per frame, sometimes many ops per frame, sometimes specify one thing that
will become many frames.
